# Lab 3: React with Ansible EDA

## Overview

In this lab, you will learn how to leverage the Event Streams API via the `crowdstrike.falcon.eventstreams` Event-Driven Ansible (EDA) source to monitor and respond to CrowdStrike Falcon events in near real-time*.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please note that events are not guaranteed to be delivered in real-time. The time it takes for an event to be delivered can vary based on the current load on the CrowdStrike Event Streams service along with other factors.

## Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- Understand the potential for using Ansible EDA to monitor and respond to CrowdStrike Falcon events
- Create rules and conditions to filter events
- Respond to events using Ansible playbooks
